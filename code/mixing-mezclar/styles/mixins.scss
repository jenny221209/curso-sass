Mixins
Some thing in CSS ara a bit tedious to write, especially with CSS3 and the many vendor prefixes that exist.
A mixin lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site.
You can even pass in values to make your mixin more flexible. A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes.
Here's an axample for transform.

/*
@mixin transform($property) {
    -webkit-transform: $property;
    -ms-trasform: $property;
    transform: $property;
}

.box { @include transform(rotate(30deg)); }
*/

@import'./nav';

*{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

.header {
    @include menu-01;
}
